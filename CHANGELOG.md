## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.8] — 2026-05-10

Generic per-agent `data/` directory and Block Kit hygiene rules. Two changes hauled out of an EA-style agent build, both useful framework-wide.

### Why

Agents that maintain cross-sweep state (cursors, CRMs, scratch JSON) had nowhere persistent to write — `memory/` is for narrative reasoning state, and the only other mounts were read-only. Writes silently evaporated when the ephemeral container exited, so each "sweep" started from zero and re-processed the entire backlog every time. Symptom: a Slack-watching EA agent kept paging the operator with a 🚨 about missing-state-on-disk, even though it had successfully written that state minutes earlier.

Separately, agents posting Slack digests with N actionable items × buttons-per-item kept tripping over a Block Kit gotcha: any button click `chat.update`s the whole message, collapsing the actions across the *other* items too — the operator loses the ability to act on anything else in that digest.

### Added

- **`agents/<name>/data/` directory.** Runner mounts it RW at `/workspace/data` inside the container if present. No schema, no naming convention — agents store any persistent runtime state they own (cursors, CRMs, snapshots, draft caches). Optional: agents that don't need it just skip the directory.
- **`shared/slack-blocks.md`: "One decision per message" rule.** A Slack message with buttons must contain exactly one actionable decision. For digests with N items, post one short header (no buttons) summarizing counts, then one follow-up `chat.postMessage` per item, each in its own thread. Eliminates the cross-item-collapse bug.
- **`shared/slack-blocks.md`: "Show before you ask" rule.** If a button approves an outbound message (reply, email, calendar invite), the exact text being sent must appear above the buttons. The button click is the send-approval on the shown text — no second confirmation step.
- **`templates/agent/data/`** scaffolded into the agent template with a `README.md` explaining the convention.

### Changed

- **`listener/src/runner.ts`:** mount `agents/<name>/data/` RW at `/workspace/data`. Sits next to the existing `memory/` (RW) and `schedules.json` (RW) mounts.

### Migration

Agents with cursor/CRM-style files should move them into `data/`:

```bash
# inside agents/<your-agent>/
mkdir -p data
mv state.json contacts.json data/
# update path refs in PROMPT.md, skills, schedules.json: ./state.json → ./data/state.json
```

Then `npm run build` in `listener/` and `pm2 restart ginnie-agents-listener --update-env`.

## [0.2.7] — 2026-05-06

Local voice-message transcription. Slack voice memos and audio attachments are now transcribed by `whisper.cpp` on the host before the agent sees them — the agent receives the transcript spliced into the message text, never the audio file. Fully offline, zero per-message cost.

### Why

Agents can't process audio. Without transcription, voice memos arrived as download stubs the agent had to fetch and then admit it couldn't read. With transcription, the user gets the same conversational experience whether they typed or spoke, and operators don't pay per minute of speech.

### Added

- **`scripts/install-whisper.sh`** — idempotent installer. Verifies prerequisites (`ffmpeg`, `cmake`/`make`, a C++ toolchain), clones `whisper.cpp` into `listener/.whisper/`, builds it, downloads the `small` multilingual model (~466 MB) from HuggingFace. If prereqs are missing it prints the exact `brew`/`apt` command and exits cleanly.
- **`listener/src/transcribe.ts`** — runtime transcription helper. Detects audio attachments by mime type, runs `whisper.cpp` against the downloaded file, returns the transcript. Falls back to the standard download-stub flow with a one-time warning if the binary isn't installed.
- **Setup skill prompt (Step 7.5).** `/setup` now asks `Do you want to enable voice-message transcription? [Y/n]` and runs the installer when the user accepts. Skipping is fine — the listener degrades gracefully.
- **Doctor checks for `ffmpeg` and `cmake`.** Optional, surfaced as `WARN` (not `FAIL`) so users without audio needs aren't blocked.
- **`templates/agent/PROMPT.md`: "Voice messages — transcribed for you"** section. Tells agents how transcripts are spliced inline and to ask if a proper noun looks misheard.

### Changed

- **`listener/src/index.ts`: audio attachments are expanded before the agent runs.** New `expandFileAttachments` splits files into audio (transcribed inline) and non-audio (kept as download stubs). Voice-only `@mentions` (no text after stripping the mention) are now accepted instead of being dropped as empty. The early `Working on it…` ack now posts before transcription so the user sees feedback in the same ~200 ms window non-audio messages get.
- **`.gitignore`: `listener/.whisper/`** — build artifacts and the model file stay local.

### Operator note

Existing installs: `bash scripts/install-whisper.sh` to enable; no listener restart required afterward (the runtime checks for the binary on each audio message). Requires `ffmpeg` on `PATH` and a C++ toolchain. Fully offline once installed.

## [0.2.6] — 2026-05-06

Stop the scheduler from silently dropping routines an agent wrote with the wrong shape, and give agents the canonical schema in their context so they don't write the wrong shape in the first place.

### Why

An agent (Casper) added four routines to its `schedules.json` and reported success. None ever fired. Root cause: the agent used `name` + `prompt` keys, but `listener/src/scheduler.ts` requires `id` + `cron` + `message`. Each entry was rejected with a single `console.warn` to PM2 logs and skipped — the agent thought it was scheduled, the operator never knew. The agent's `PROMPT.md` had been customized in a way that lost the routines section from the template, so it had no schema reference in context.

### Added

- **`framework/skills/routines/SKILL.md`** — canonical routines schema, jq edit recipes, cron format, and a list of common mistakes that get silently dropped. Auto-injected into every agent's system prompt by `docker/entrypoint.mjs` alongside `memory-curation/SKILL.md`. Every agent — current, future, however customized — now has the schema in context.
- **`listener/src/scheduler.ts`: persisted reject log.** Invalid entries are still skipped, but now also recorded to `data/scheduler-rejects.json` with a specific reason per entry (missing fields named, bad cron expression quoted, parse error, etc.). On a clean reload the agent's record is removed.
- **`listener/src/watcher-checks.ts: checkSchedulerRejects()`.** Reads the reject file and produces one alert per affected agent, listing each rejected entry's id and reason. Wired into `runAllChecks` with the existing 24h cooldown machinery, so a save → fix cycle doesn't churn alerts.

### Operator note

The reject DM goes through the watcher process (`WATCHER_BOT_TOKEN` + `OPERATOR_SLACK_ID` in `.env`). If the watcher isn't configured, the reject file is still written and visible at `data/scheduler-rejects.json` — the alerts just aren't delivered until the watcher is up. See the `setup-watcher` skill.

## [0.2.5] — 2026-04-29

Plumbing fix for Slack file uploads + matching template guidance so agents actually do something with the file once it lands.

### Fixed

- **`listener/src/index.ts`: file uploads no longer silently dropped.** The message handler returned early on any event with a `subtype`, which killed Slack's `file_share` events before the existing file-attachment formatter further down the same handler could ever run. Now `file_share` falls through; everything else (`channel_join`, `bot_message`, edits, etc.) still bails as before.

### Changed

- **`templates/agent/PROMPT.md`: spell out three rules agents kept missing.**
  - **Threading.** The listener has always prepended `Slack message (channel: X, thread: Y): ... Reply in Slack channel X, thread Y.` to inbound messages, but the previous template only mentioned `thread_ts` as a buried afterthought after a `chat.postMessage` example that *omitted* it. Agents copied the example. The default postMessage example now *is* the threaded form, with an explicit "extract THREAD_TS, default to including it" rule.
  - **File attachments.** The listener already appends `Attached files:` blocks with a pre-built `Download:` curl command, but the template never told agents what to do with them. Agents ignored uploads or claimed they couldn't see them. Added a step-by-step: run the download, process by mimetype (`Read` for text/images, dedicated skill for PDFs, honest "I can't read this" for binaries), and quote what you read back so the user knows you actually parsed it.
  - **Tabular data.** Slack does not render markdown tables; pipes-and-dashes show up as raw text. Agents kept producing them. Added explicit guidance: code-block monospace alignment, Block Kit `section.fields` for label/value cards, file upload for big tables, and a strong default to prefer prose with bold numbers.

No code changes outside the listener fix and the template prose. New agents created via `/create-agent` inherit the better defaults; existing agents can copy the relevant sections into their own `PROMPT.md`.

## [0.2.4] — 2026-04-29

Surfaces Anthropic's [authentication policy](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance#authentication-and-credential-use) and adds a fully-supported alternative auth path for operators whose use case doesn't fit "ordinary individual use of Claude Code by the subscriber." Subscription OAuth tokens (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` from `claude setup-token`) remain the default for personal/internal automation; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is now first-class for automation, products, and multi-user scenarios.

### Added

- **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a first-class auth mode.** The runner (`listener/src/runner.ts`) accepts either env var and prefers `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` when both are set (explicit > inherited). The chosen credential is injected into every container; the host `~/.claude/.credentials.json` mount only kicks in when neither env var is set. `templates/agent/run.sh` carries the matching precedence in bash form.
- **Authentication and cost section in README.md.** Lays out both options side-by-side, names the policy risk on Option A explicitly (token revocation / account suspension if the install routes requests on behalf of other users), and recommends Option B for any use case that looks like a hosted product or external-customer-facing agent.
- **New `Auth` section on the website** (`ginnie-agents-website` repo) mirroring the README split, with a link to Anthropic's policy.
- **`setup` skill branches on the auth choice.** Step 2 of `.claude/skills/setup/SKILL.md` presents both options with the policy disclosure verbatim and routes through the chosen branch (each branch clears the other env var so the resulting `.env` is single-mode).

### Changed

- **`scripts/doctor.sh`** passes if either `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set with a plausible format, and labels the active mode in the output.
- **`listener/src/watcher-checks.ts` `checkTokenAge`** skips when API key is the active auth — API keys don't expire on a fixed schedule, so the day-counting alert has no signal there.
- **`.claude/skills/doctor/SKILL.md`** and **`.claude/skills/setup-watcher/SKILL.md`** gate token-age and token-issued-at marker steps on Option A.
- **`.env.example`, `docker/entrypoint.mjs`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`** updated to document both modes; the auth-flow and threat-model sections in `ARCHITECTURE.md` no longer assume a single credential type.
- **README hero subtitle** dropped the "No API keys" claim; eligibility list and Quickstart prereqs no longer assume a Max subscription.
- Threat model in `ARCHITECTURE.md` extended (carried over from late-v0.2.3 work) with the rationale for not pursuing per-agent `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` isolation (one of the four deferred items from the v0.2.2 audit, #3). `claude setup-token` mints account-wide tokens with no per-app scope, so per-agent splitting doesn't reduce blast radius — it just creates N equivalent leak surfaces on the same host. Documented as won't-fix-by-design; the same reasoning generalizes to API keys.

### Migration

- **No breaking changes for existing installs.** Operators on Option A (the prior default) keep their `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` and continue working. Operators who want to switch can: generate a key at console.anthropic.com → set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<key>` in `.env` → restart the listener (`pm2 restart ginnie-agents-listener`). When both env vars are set, the API key wins; clear `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=` afterwards to keep `.env` single-mode.

## [0.2.3] — 2026-04-28

Continuation of the security-hardening track from issue #3. Closes two of the four deferred items from v0.2.2 (sender-identity enforcement at dispatch; signed-tag check on framework updates). The remaining two — `--read-only` Docker rootfs and per-agent token isolation — are still open.

### Added

- **Sender-identity dispatch gate** (`listener/src/index.ts`, `listener/src/runner.ts`). For agents with `boundaries: "write"`, the listener now refuses to dispatch messages from senders whose resolved role is `unknown` (Slack API lookup failed) or `external` (real Slack user not in the merged `shared/known-users.json` ∪ per-agent `known-users.json`). Curated users pass through regardless of the role string they were curated with; other workspace bots (`role: bot`) also pass through. Read-only agents are not gated. Refusals are logged as `[<agent>] dispatch refused: unverified sender …`. Defense-in-depth: `PROMPT.md` already tells agents to be cautious with unknown senders, but a successful injection bypasses prompt-level guidance — this gate keeps the agent from waking up at all. Per-agent opt-out: `"allow_unverified_senders": true` in `config.json` (e.g. for a `read-only` Q&A bot in a public channel where random Slack users should be answered, or for an operator who'd rather rely on prompt-level filtering).
- **Signed-tag verification in `scripts/update-framework.sh`.** Default off for backward compat; opt in by setting `FRAMEWORK_REQUIRE_SIGNED_TAG=true` in `.env`. When enabled, `update-framework.sh` requires the upstream tip (`FRAMEWORK_UPSTREAM`) to point at a git tag, AND requires that tag to be signed by a key in the operator's `gpg` keyring. The check happens after `git fetch` and before `git pull`; on failure the script exits non-zero without applying any change. Operators who want this protection should pin `FRAMEWORK_UPSTREAM` at a release branch where each release is tagged-and-signed, or at a specific tag ref. Closes the prior trust model where push access to the upstream remote alone was enough to ship code that runs on every install.

### Changed

- Threat model in `ARCHITECTURE.md` updated to reflect both new defenses (`What the framework protects against` gains the sender-identity gate; `A malicious framework upstream` now names `FRAMEWORK_REQUIRE_SIGNED_TAG` as the trust knob).
- `templates/agent/config.json` includes `"allow_unverified_senders": false` for visibility, so new agents created via the `create-agent` skill see the field and the default.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-04-28

Security hardening from a community audit (issue #3, thanks @gabiudrescu). Closes the immediate easy wins; the deeper architectural items (sender-identity enforcement, `--read-only` filesystem, supply-chain trust controls) are scoped for a later release and tracked in #3.

### Added

- **Threat model** section in `ARCHITECTURE.md` that names what the framework assumes (trusted Slack workspace, trusted host, trusted upstream remote), what it protects against, and what it does NOT protect against (prompt-injection-driven token exfil, outbound data exfil from a `read-only` agent, host compromise, malicious framework upstream). Names the assumption rather than leaving it implicit.

### Changed

- **`boundaries: "read-only"` framing corrected** in both `README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Previous wording ("hard SDK-level guarantee") was overclaiming. New wording: prevents *local mutation* (no `Bash`/`Write`/`Edit`), does not prevent *outbound data exfiltration* (a read-only agent can still `Read` and `WebFetch`).

### Fixed

- **Slack file-upload filename injection** (`listener/src/index.ts`). Filenames in Slack file uploads were interpolated raw into both the agent's prompt and the curl shell command the agent then executed. A crafted filename could inject arbitrary shell commands or prompt instructions. Now: filename used in the shell `curl -o` path is sanitized to an alphanumeric/`._-` allowlist; filename appearing in the prompt is `JSON.stringify`'d so injection-shaped names render as escaped string literals; only files served from `https://files.slack.com/` are accepted.
- **Watcher `/watcher` slash command and button handlers gated to `OPERATOR_SLACK_ID`** (`listener/src/watcher.ts`). Previous version accepted slash commands from any user in the workspace (and button clicks from any user who could see the message), so anyone could `/watcher pause 168` to silence alerts for a week. Defense-in-depth on top of DM scoping.
- **Container hardening flags added** (`listener/src/runner.ts`): `--cap-drop=ALL`, `--security-opt=no-new-privileges`, `--pids-limit=512`. Prevents capability-based escape, privilege escalation via setuid, and fork-bomb-style PID exhaustion. The `--read-only` filesystem flag is NOT yet added; it requires explicit tmpfs + per-mount review and is on the next round.

### Known limitations (deferred to a later release)

- Prompt-injection-driven token exfiltration via Slack messages remains an architectural risk; the framework documents the threat in ARCHITECTURE.md but does not yet enforce sender-identity at the dispatch level. Framework-level "refuse to dispatch from `unknown`/`external` senders for write-capable agents" is on the v0.2.x roadmap.
- `--read-only` Docker filesystem with explicit tmpfs/RW mounts is on the same roadmap.
- Signed-tag requirement for `update-framework.sh` (supply-chain trust) is on the same roadmap.

[0.2.2]: https://github.com/nitaybz/ginnie-agents/releases/tag/v0.2.2

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-27

Polish from first real install on a private fork: stop alerting on the wrong remote, eliminate the recurring "I lost the rotated config token" footgun, and make avatar prep and manifest creation reliable.

### Added

- `scripts/rotate-slack-config-token.sh` — atomic helper. Rotates `SLACK_CONFIG_TOKEN` + `SLACK_CONFIG_REFRESH_TOKEN` and persists the new pair to `.env` via temp-write-and-rename before returning the new access token. Skills must call this instead of hitting `tooling.tokens.rotate` directly. Closes the recurring bug where a rotation would succeed but the new pair would never make it to disk, leaving the install locked out.
- `FRAMEWORK_UPSTREAM` env var (default `origin/main`) — names the git ref the Watcher and `update-framework.sh` treat as "the framework upstream." Fork-and-track installs (private origin, public framework on `upstream`) set `FRAMEWORK_UPSTREAM=upstream/main`.
- `data/framework-version.txt` — records the public sha currently deployed. `update-framework.sh` writes it after every successful pull. The Watcher's `checkFrameworkUpdate` reads it as the comparison base, so installs whose git HEAD points at unrelated private history don't get every public commit alerted as a "framework update."
- Avatar preparation step in both `setup-watcher` and `create-agent` skills. ImageMagick one-liner to resize + center-crop input images to a Slack-ready 1024×1024 PNG. Anchored documentation since the wrong gravity (default center) chops the head off any portrait whose subject is in the upper half — use `-gravity north` for top-anchored crops.

### Changed

- Manifest API calls in skills now strip the `_comment` field via `jq -c 'del(._comment)'` before sending. Slack's manifest API rejects unknown top-level fields; the `_comment` annotation in `templates/*-slack-manifest.json` is documentation only and must not be sent.
- `setup-watcher` skill now uses `bash scripts/rotate-slack-config-token.sh` instead of an inline curl + python rewrite. Same for `create-agent`.

### Notes for upgrades from v0.2.0

If you're already running v0.2.0 with a private origin (the fork-and-track shape), you'll want to:
1. Add the public framework as an upstream remote: `git remote add upstream git@github.com:nitaybz/ginnie-agents.git`
2. Set `FRAMEWORK_UPSTREAM=upstream/main` in `.env`
3. Pin the deployed version: `git fetch upstream && git rev-parse upstream/main > data/framework-version.txt`
4. Restart the Watcher: `pm2 restart ginnie-agents-watcher --update-env`

[0.2.1]: https://github.com/nitaybz/ginnie-agents/releases/tag/v0.2.1

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-26

The Watcher.

### Added

- **Watcher** — long-running framework watchdog daemon (`listener/src/watcher.ts`). Bolt + Socket Mode, no AI, no Claude tokens. Runs alongside the listener as a second PM2 process (`ginnie-agents-watcher`).
  - Periodic checks (default hourly): token age, framework update available on `origin/main`, PM2 listener health, disk usage, per-agent memory caps.
  - DMs the operator only when something fires. 24h cooldown per alert key. Acks/skips persist in `data/watcher-state.json`.
  - **Interactive buttons** on actionable alerts:
    - Framework update → `[Update now]` `[Remind tomorrow]` `[Skip this version]`. `[Update now]` shells out to `scripts/update-framework.sh`, streams progress as message edits.
    - Listener errored → `[View logs]` `[Restart listener]`
    - Memory cap → `[Ack 24h]` `[Ack 7d]`
  - **`/watcher` slash command** with subcommands: `help`, `status`, `check`, `pause [hours]`, `resume`, `doctor`.
- `scripts/update-framework.sh` — deterministic update flow (git pull → conditional docker rebuild → conditional listener rebuild → pm2 restart → doctor). Used by the Watcher's `[Update now]` button and runnable manually.
- `templates/watcher-slack-manifest.json` — canonical manifest for the Watcher's Slack app (Socket Mode, interactivity, `/watcher` slash command, `chat:write` + `im:write` + `users:read` + `commands` scopes).
- `setup-watcher` skill — replaces `setup-maintenance-bot`. Walks user through manifest-based Slack app creation, captures bot+app tokens, writes `WATCHER_BOT_TOKEN` / `WATCHER_APP_TOKEN` / `OPERATOR_SLACK_ID` to `.env`.

### Changed

- `ecosystem.config.cjs` — second PM2 app entry `ginnie-agents-watcher` (script `dist/watcher.js`).
- README + ARCHITECTURE — Watcher replaces the maintenance bot as the canonical bot example. Pattern: bots are deterministic + non-AI, but they can be small Bolt daemons when interactivity matters.

### Removed

- `scripts/maintenance.sh` — the v0.1.0 cron-based maintenance bot. Never publicly used; removed clean rather than deprecated.
- `.claude/skills/setup-maintenance-bot/` — replaced by `setup-watcher/`.

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/nitaybz/ginnie-agents/releases/tag/v0.2.0

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-26

Initial public release. Validated end-to-end via fresh-clone dogfood: setup → create-agent → live Slack DM round-trip with SOUL voice intact + memory written to episodes.

### Added

- Framework extracted from internal deployment.
- Three-tier memory model with `commit-msg` hook enforcement (rules ≤200 lines, playbook ≤300 lines, episodes append-only).
- `merge=union` git attribute on memory paths to prevent silent merge loss.
- Per-agent Slack apps via multi-app `@slack/bolt` Socket Mode.
- Auto-injected team directory rendered from `shared/known-users.json`.
- `SOUL.md` auto-injection between team directory and operational layer.
- Docker isolation per agent with read-only framework/shared mounts.
- `framework/skills/` directory for framework-internal skills auto-mounted into every agent.
- `templates/agent/` scaffold with `PROMPT.md`, `SOUL.md`, memory tiers, schedules, Slack config.
- Known-users **shared ∪ local merge** with per-entry override (selective agent visibility). Per-agent `agents/<n>/known-users.json` is mounted into the container, merged with `shared/known-users.json` by the entrypoint, and used by the listener for sender identity resolution.
- **Boundaries** as a first-class `config.json` field. `"boundaries": "read-only"` restricts the agent's `allowed_tools` to a read-only allowlist (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`) at SDK level — `Bash`, `Write`, and `Edit` are blocked regardless of what the prompt says.
- **Work hours** as a first-class `config.json` field. `enabled`/`start`/`end`/`days`/`off_hours_behavior`. Inbound user messages outside work hours are either silently dropped (`ignore`) or get an off-hours notice (`deferred_response` / `queue`). Scheduled routines fire regardless.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` documenting the 8-layer agent model, system prompt composition, mount layout, memory enforcement, and update flow.
- Nine framework skills under `.claude/skills/`:
  - `setup` — first-run guided setup
  - `create-agent` — full agent scaffolding flow
  - `update-framework` — pull updates, rebuild, restart
  - `doctor` — health check across prerequisites, env, hooks, listener, agents, memory caps, disk
  - `manage-known-users` — add/edit/remove humans and agents with visibility tree question
  - `manage-routines` — view/add/edit/disable schedules
  - `manage-work-hours` — set work hours and off-hours behavior
  - `logs` — tail/search/download listener and per-agent logs
  - `setup-maintenance-bot` — wire up the optional script-based maintenance bot. Replaces the original `create-maintenance-agent` skill, which wrapped purely-mechanical checks (`df`, `git fetch`, `wc -l`) in a full Claude Agent SDK container per scan. The bot is now `scripts/maintenance.sh` — runs via cron or PM2 cron-restart, deterministic, free, and fast. Same checks (token expiry, framework updates, listener health, disk, memory caps) as before, plus a 24h-per-key cooldown system to keep Slack quiet. ARCHITECTURE.md formalizes the agent-vs-bot distinction.

### Changed

- `prompt.md` → `PROMPT.md` (uppercase, matches `SOUL.md` as identity files).
- `memory-curation` skill moved from `shared/skills/` to `framework/skills/` (framework-managed, not user-editable).
- Default timezone changed from a hardcoded zone to `UTC`. Override via `TZ` env var.
- Auth flow: `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (1-year token from `claude setup-token`) is now the recommended path over mounting host `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (8h OAuth, non-refreshable in container).
- `getSenderInfo()` now takes an optional agent context to resolve sender identity from the merged shared ∪ local known-users.

### Removed

- All agents from the internal deployment.
- Internal business context (`shared/foundation.md`, `shared/known-users.json` contents, internal task-board skill, internal CRM-reference skill).
- Hardcoded host paths and private network IPs.
